## Overview

``bbpy`` provides a generic and modular framework to develop **Branch-and-Bound algorithms** in python.
The package allows to:
- Define your own optimization problems and implement tailored Branch-and-Bound algorithms from template classes to make the development easier.
- Use some built-in instances of optimization problems and associated Branch-and-Bound algorithms.

<!--
The package is organized in three main modules:

- `bbpy.problem` which gather template classes to define an optimization problem
- `bbpy.bnb` which gather template classes to implement a Branch-and-Bound algorithm
- `bbpy.instances` which gather some built-in instances of optimization problems and associated Branch-and-Bound algorithms
